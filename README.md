# 42's PISCINE

### Here you will find some of the most useefull exercices we made during our piscine at 42 school. ###

Here's the list of all exercices I push in this repo : 
  - **Print Comb** : a simple exercice about learning while loops
  - **Print Comb 02** : same thing but with more diffculty
  - **Putnbr** : one of the most basic BUT important exerice.
             DO NOT SKIP OR GO DIRECTLY FOR THE SOLUTION FOR THIS ONE.
             How to display an int with write function ?
             Think about recursion and euclidian division...
             By the way I'll give a great tip 
             -> When you need to go from a number (0 to 9) to it's equivalent in the ASCII table (char) you will need to add to the number 48.
             I let you search why 48...
 - **Swap** : A very straight forward exercice once you understood how pointers works in C. You will use this one innumerable times, so get it done correctly.
 - **Putstr** : If you know that a string ends with a "\0" in C, you will know how to manipulate those back and forth without any issues.
 - **Strlen** : You will need this one everytime you use strings and solving more exercices about them. Again, you need to know perfectly how a string is formed in C and you will be good to go.
